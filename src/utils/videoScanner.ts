/**
 * Automatically detects and tracks loading progress of video elements on the page
 *
 * This scanner provides comprehensive monitoring of all `<video>` elements in the DOM,
 * handling various video formats, loading states, and network conditions. It includes
 * advanced timeout protection to ensure progress tracking never gets stuck on problematic
 * video sources, making it perfect for asset-heavy applications and media galleries.
 *
 * **Key Features:**
 * - **Automatic Detection**: Uses `document.querySelectorAll('video')` for complete coverage
 * - **Intelligent State Tracking**: Monitors HTML5 video readyState for accurate progress
 * - **Timeout Protection**: 7-second failsafe prevents stuck progress on broken videos
 * - **Concurrent Loading**: Handles multiple videos loading simultaneously without conflicts
 * - **Error Resilience**: Failed/timed-out videos don't prevent overall completion
 *
 * **Video Loading Process:**
 * 1. **Detection Phase**: Scans DOM for all `<video>` elements regardless of source
 * 2. **State Assessment**: Checks each video's current readyState (0-4 scale)
 * 3. **Event Monitoring**: Sets up listeners for videos still loading
 * 4. **Timeout Racing**: Races actual loading against 7-second timeout
 * 5. **State Updates**: Updates parent component state as videos complete or fail
 *
 * **HTML5 Video readyState Reference:**
 * - `0` **HAVE_NOTHING** - No video data available
 * - `1` **HAVE_METADATA** - Video metadata loaded (duration, dimensions, etc.)
 * - `2` **HAVE_CURRENT_DATA** - Current frame data available
 * - `3` **HAVE_FUTURE_DATA** - Enough data for immediate playback
 * - `4` **HAVE_ENOUGH_DATA** - Sufficient data for uninterrupted playback
 *
 * **Timeout Protection Rationale:**
 * The 7-second timeout handles real-world edge cases that can break asset loading:
 * - **Malformed Sources**: `<source>` tags with invalid URLs that never error
 * - **Network Timeouts**: Slow connections that hang without failing
 * - **CORS Issues**: Cross-origin videos that silently fail to load
 * - **Corrupted Files**: Videos with damaged headers that confuse browsers
 * - **Server Issues**: Temporary server problems causing indefinite loading
 *
 * **Performance Considerations:**
 * - **Memory Efficient**: Uses `{ once: true }` event listeners to prevent memory leaks
 * - **Non-blocking**: Asynchronous processing doesn't impact page rendering
 * - **Scalable**: Handles dozens of videos without performance degradation
 * - **Resource Aware**: Timeout prevents infinite resource consumption
 *
 * @param setLoadedCount - React state setter to increment successful video load count
 * @param setFailedCount - React state setter to increment failed video load count
 *
 * @returns Object containing the total number of video elements detected
 * @returns returns.totalVideos - Count of all `<video>` elements found on the page
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Basic integration with React state management
 * function VideoTracker() {
 *   const [loadedCount, setLoadedCount] = useState(0);
 *   const [failedCount, setFailedCount] = useState(0);
 *
 *   const { totalVideos } = scanVideos(setLoadedCount, setFailedCount);
 *
 *   return (
 *     <div>
 *       Videos: {loadedCount} loaded, {failedCount} failed of {totalVideos} total
 *     </div>
 *   );
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Usage within asset loading system
 * useEffect(() => {
 *   const { totalVideos } = scanVideos(
 *     (count) => setTotalLoaded(prev => prev + count),
 *     (count) => setTotalFailed(prev => prev + count)
 *   );
 *   setTotalAssets(prev => prev + totalVideos);
 * }, []);
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```html
 * <!-- All these video types are automatically detected -->
 * <!-- Single source video -->
 * <video src="presentation.mp4" controls></video>
 *
 * <!-- Multi-source video with fallbacks -->
 * <video controls preload="metadata">
 *   <source src="demo.webm" type="video/webm">
 *   <source src="demo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
 *   <source src="demo.ogv" type="video/ogg">
 * </video>
 *
 * <!-- Background video (common in modern web design) -->
 * <video autoplay muted loop>
 *   <source src="hero-background.mp4" type="video/mp4">
 * </video>
 *
 * <!-- Even problematic videos won't block overall progress -->
 * <video controls>
 *   <source src="https://broken-cdn.com/missing-video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
 * </video>
 * ```
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * // Real-world usage patterns and expected results
 *
 * // Scenario 1: Fast-loading cached videos
 * // Result: Immediate "loaded" state for readyState >= 4 videos
 *
 * // Scenario 2: Large videos on slow connections
 * // Result: Proper event-based tracking until canplay or 7s timeout
 *
 * // Scenario 3: Broken video URLs
 * // Result: Either immediate error event or 7s timeout â†’ marked as failed
 *
 * // Scenario 4: Mixed video states
 * // Result: Each video tracked independently, progress updates in real-time
 * ```
 *
 * **Browser Compatibility:**
 * - **Modern browsers**: Full support (Chrome 4+, Firefox 3.5+, Safari 4+, Edge 12+)
 * - **HTML5 Video API**: Uses standard readyState and event APIs
 * - **Promise support**: Requires ES6 Promise support (polyfill available for older browsers)
